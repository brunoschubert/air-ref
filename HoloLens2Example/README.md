## Prerequisites
s
* Windows 10 1809 or later
* Windows 10 SDK 10.0.18362.0 or later
* [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/download) 4.26 or later
* Microsoft HoloLens 2 device [configured for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/develop/platform-capabilities-and-apis/using-visual-studio#enabling-developer-mode) or [Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/develop/platform-capabilities-and-apis/using-the-hololens-emulator#hololens-2-emulator-overview)
* [Visual Studio 2019 with the required workloads](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unreal/tutorials/unreal-uxt-ch1#installing-visual-studio-2019)

# Setup

1. Clone or download this sample repository
* If you do not have a HoloLens 2 device, first follow the [App Packaging Instructions](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Platforms/AR/HoloLens2/HowTo/PackageApp/index.html) and then follow the [Emulator Quickstart Instructions](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Platforms/AR/HoloLens2/QuickStartEmulator/index.html) to deploy the app to the [HoloLens 2 Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/using-the-hololens-emulator)
* If you have a HoloLens 2 device and want to run the app on device, first follow the [App Packaging Instructions](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Platforms/AR/HoloLens2/HowTo/PackageApp/index.html) and then follow the [Device Quickstart Instructions](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Platforms/AR/HoloLens2/QuickStartDevice/index.html) to deploy the app to your HoloLens 2
* If you have a HoloLens 2 device and want to stream the app to device, follow the [Streaming Quickstart Instructions](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Platforms/AR/HoloLens2/QuickStartStreaming/index.html) to stream the app from the Unreal editor to your HoloLens 2

## Running the sample

1. Press the **Spawn** button to bring up the launch pin. 
* The launch pin is steered by head gaze, aiming at a horizontal planar surface will allow you to [airtap](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/gestures#air-tap) to place a character anchor.
2. Pressing  **Save Pins** will store the anchors to the device.
3. Pressing **Clear Pins** will delete the anchor information stored on device (but will not remove current live anchors).
4. If the app is closed and/or reset, pressing **Load Pins** will restore the saved characters and anchors. 

### On the Emulator

You can also use key presses to trigger the buttons. Make sure you uncheck **Use keyboard for simulation** in the [simulation control panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/using-the-hololens-emulator#simulation-control-panel) first. Press 1 for **Spawn**, 2 for **Save Pins**, 3 for **Clear Pins**, and 4 for **Load Pins**.
